## Polifills

If you want to use some exotic ES features and search some polifill, you can use
[core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) as described here
[https://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration).
By default boilerplate doesn't includes any polifills, to reduce bundle size.
